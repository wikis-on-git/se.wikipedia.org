'''Sápmi''' is the name of the [[cultural geography|cultural]] [[subregion|region]] traditionally inhabited by the [[Sámi people]]. Sápmi is located in [[Northern Europe]] and includes the northern parts of [[Fennoscandia]]. The region stretches over four countries: [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Russia]]. Sápmi is the name in North Sámi , while the Julev Sámi name is ''Sábme'' and the South Sámi name is ''Saemie''. In Norwegian and Swedish the term ''Sameland'' is often used. It is frequently mistaken for being synonymous with ''Lapland'' (see [[Sápmi (area)#Etymology|Etymology]]). 

With the fall of the Soviet Union and increasing [[internationalization]], cross-border co-operation is becoming more important, and existing state borders less important both for the Sámi indigenous population and non-Sámi inhabitants - the latter constituting the majority population of the region. Russians and Norwegians are the most numerous groups, and the Sámi make up only a small minority of about 5%.<ref>100.000 out of 2.000.000.</ref> No political organization advocates secession, though several groups desire more territorial autonomy and/or more self-determination for the region's indigenous population.

The region has its own football team, the [[Sápmi national football team|Sámi Spábbáčiekčanlihttu]], that plays in the [[NF-Board]], won the 2006 [[Viva World Cup]] and will host the 2008 event.

== Etymology ==
Sápmi (and corresponding terms in other Sámi languages) refers to both the Sámi land and the Sámi people. In fact, the word "Sámi" is only the accusative-genitive form of the noun "Sápmi" - making the nation's name (''Sámi olbmot'') simply mean "people of Sápmi." The source of the word is speculated to be related to the Baltic word ''*ẑeme'' that simply means 'land'.[1] 

In historical texts the Swedish names "Lappland", "Lapland" or [[Lappmarken]] may occur, and also the Norwegian name "Finnmark" or "Finnmork."<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/egil/egil15.htm Egil's Saga, Chapter XIV]</ref>. Originally these two names did refer to the entire Sápmi, but subsequently became applied to areas ''exclusively'' inhabited by the Sámi and today they are names of provinces that only constitute parts of Sápmi. (See: [[Sápmi (area)#Politics|Politics]]).

== Geography ==
=== Landscape ===
The largest part of Sápmi lies north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. The western portion is an area of fjords, deep valleys, glaciers, and mountains, the highest point being Mount [[Kebnekaise]] (2,111 m/6,926 ft), in Swedish Lapland. The part of Sápmi falling on the Swedish side of the border is characterized by great rivers running from the northwest to the southeast. From the Norwegian province of Finnmark and eastwards, the terrain is that of a low plateau that contains many marshes and lakes, the largest of which is [[Lake Inari]] in Finnish Lapland. The extreme northeastern section lies within the [[tundra]] region, but it does not have [[permafrost]].

=== Climate ===
The climate is [[subarctic]] and vegetation is sparse, except in the densely forested southern portion. The mountainous west coast has significantly milder winters and more precipitation than the large areas east of the mountain chain. North of the Arctic Circle [[polar night]] characterize the winter season and [[midnight sun]] the summer season - both phenomena are longer the further north you go. Traditionally, the Sámi divide the year in ''eight'' seasons instead of four.

=== Resources ===
Sápmi contains valuable mineral deposits, particularly [[iron]] ore in Sweden, copper in Norway, and [[nickel]] and [[apatite]] in Russia. Sea and river fisheries abound in the region. Steamers are operated on some of the lakes, and many ports are ice-free throughout the year. All ports along the [[Norwegian Sea]] in the west and the [[Barents Sea]] in the north east to [[Murmansk]] are ice-free all year. The [[Gulf of Bothnia]] usually freezes over in winter. The ocean floor to the north and west of Sápmi has great deposits of [[oil]] and [[gas]].

== Cultural subdivisions ==
=== East Sápmi ===
''East Sápmi'' consists of the [[Kola peninsula]] and the Lake [[Inari]] region, and is home to the eastern Sámi languages. While being the most heavily populated part of Sápmi, this is also the region where the indigenous population and their culture is weakest. Corresponds to the regions marked 6. - 9. on the map below.

=== Central Sápmi ===
''Central Sápmi'' consists of the western part of Finland's Sámi Domicile Area, the parts of Norway north of the [[Saltfjellet]] mountains and areas on the Swedish side corresponding to this. Central Sápmi is the region where Sámi culture is strongest, and home to North Sámi - the most vital of the Sámi languages. In the southernmost part of this sub-region, however, Sámi culture is rather weak - this is the home of the moribound ''Bithun'' Sámi language. The areas around the [[Tysfjord]] fjord in Norway and the river [[Lule]] in Sweden is home to the ''Julev'' Sámi language, one of the more vital groups. Corresponds to the regions marked 3. - 5. on the map below.

=== South Sápmi ===
''South Sápmi'' consists of the areas south of Saltfjellet and corresponding areas in Sweden, and is home to the southern languages. In this area Sámi culture is mostly visible on the inland, and the languages are spoken by few. Corresponds to the regions marked 1 and 2 on the map below.

=== Lapland ===
The inner parts of Sápmi are often referred to as [[Lapland]] or [[Lappi]] a name deriving from a former name given to the Sámi, which is today considered derogatory by many Sámi. The name is also found on the Russian side as ''Laplandija'' (the name of a natural reservation) and the Norwegian county of Finnmark is sometimes titled the "Norwegian Lapland", especially by the travel industry.<ref>[http://www.visitnorway.com/templates/NTRDestinationArticle.aspx?id=157023 Presentation of Finnmark by Norway's Ministry of Trade and Industry] in their official travel guide to Norway.</ref> ''Lappi-'' appears as a common component of place-names throughout central and southern Finland as well; in many cases it probably refers to earlier Sámi presence, though in some cases the underlying meaning may be merely 'periphery' or 'outlying district'.

=== "Sides" ===
Finally, Sápmi may also be sub-divided into cultural regions according to the states' borders, that obviously affects daily life for people no matter their ethnicity. By Sámi, these regions are commonly referred to as "sides", f. ex. "the Norwegian Side" (''norgga bealli'') and "the Finnish side" (''suoma bealli'').

== Languages ==
[[File:Corrected sami map II.PNG|thumb|300px|]]

=== Saamic (Sámi) languages ===
{{Main article|Sámi languages}}
The so-called [[Sámi language|Saamic]] languages are the region's main minority languages and also its original languages. They belong to the [[Uralic language family]], and are most closely related to the [[Baltic-Finnic]] languages. Many Sámi languages are mutually unintelligible, but the languages form a continuum stretching southwest-northeast, so that a message could hypothetically be passed between Sámi-speakers from one end to the other and be understood by all. Today, however, many of the languages are moribound and thus there are "holes" in the original continuum.

On the map to the right numbers indicate Sami Languages: 1. South (Åarjil) Sámi, 2. Ume (Upme) Sámi, 3. Pite (Bitthun)Sámi, 4. Lule (Julev) Sámi, 5. North (Davvi) Sámi, 6. Skolt Sámi, 7. Inari (Ánár) Sámi, 8. Kildin Sámi, 9. Ter Sámi. Of these languages the Northern one is the by far most vital; whereas Ume, Pite and Ter seem to be dying languages. Darkened areas represent municipalities that recognize Sami as an official language. 

North Sámi is subdivided into three main dialects: West, East and Coast. The written standard is based on the Western dialect.

=== East Slavonic languages ===
{{Main article|Russian language}}
The language spoken by most people in the region is Russian, which is an [[East Slavic|East Slavonic]] language. It is the dominant language on the Russian side of the border, and also spoken by recently immigrated minority groups elsewhere in Sápmi. Earlier, a common [[pidgin]] language was spoken on the northern coast of Sápmi that combined elements of Russian, Norwegian, North Sámi and Kven. This language was known as [[Russenorsk]]. On the Russian side, there are also speakers of the East Slavonic languages [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], which are both mutually intelligible with Russian.

=== North Germanic (Scandinavian) languages ===
{{Main article|Norwegian language|Swedish language}}
Norwegian and Swedish dominate the largest part of Sápmi, including the entire Southern region and most of the Central region. There also used to be minorities speaking Norwegian on the Kola Peninsula. The languages are completely mutually intelligible, much more so than f. ex. South Sámi and North Sámi. The dialects spoken in the Sámi areas differ very much from the written standard, particularly North and Central Norwegian from the standard [[bokmål]]. In Central Sápmi the Scandinavian dialects have taken the Uralic trait of having a more-or-less constant emphasis on the first syllable of each spoken word. In the inner and northernmost parts of Sweden and Norway, however, people often speak standard Norwegian and Swedish - though with a heavy Uralic accent. 
Other North Germanic languages include [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] - the two latter not being understandable for other Scandinavian-speakers.

=== Baltic-Finnic languages ===
{{Main article|Meänkieli|Kven language|Finnish language}}
The Baltic-Finnic languages are spoken on the Finnish (Finnish), Swedish (Meänkieli - spoken by the Tornedalians) and Norwegian (Kven) sides of the borders. There also used to be minorities speaking Finnish on the Kola Peninsula. The languages are as mutually intelligible as the Scandinavian languages. Other Baltic-Finnic languages include [[Karelian language|Karelian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Livonian language|Livonian]], [[Veps language|Veps]], [[Votic language|Votic]] and [[Ingrian language|Izhoran]]. Many are mutually intelligible.

== Demography ==
The approximate number of people living in Sápmi is about 2 million, though it is difficult to give the precise number of inhabitants since certain counties and provinces only include ''parts'' of Sápmi. It is also quite difficult to account for the distribution of ethnic groups as many people have double or multiple ethnic identities - both seeing themselves as members of the majority population ''and'' being part of one or more minority group. 

=== Sámi ===
{{Main article|Sami people}}
Different criteria are set when calculating the number of Sámi, but the number is generally given as somewhere between 80.000 and 100.000. It should be noted, though, that many live in areas outside Sápmi such as [[Trondheim]], [[Oslo]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Helsinki]].

=== Russians ===
{{Main article|Russians}}
About 900.000 people inhabit [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk province]] (oblast'), but parts of this area lies outside Sápmi. About 758.600 of Murmansk's population claim to be exclusively Russian. It should be noted, however, that ethnic Russians also live [[Russian diaspora|elsewhere]] in Sápmi. The Russian side of Sápmi is very ethnically diverse, with particularly big [[Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] minorities. The Sámi are one of the minor minorities in this part of Sápmi.

=== Norwegians ===
{{Main article|Norwegians}}
About 850.000 people inhabit the Norwegian regions (''landsdeler'') [[North Norway]] (fully within Sápmi) and [[Trøndelag]] (mostly within Sápmi). However, many of the regions' inhabitants - particularly those of North Norway - are not exclusively Norwegian. Notable minority groups include the Sámi and the [[Kvens]].

=== Swedes ===
{{Main article|Swedes}}
About 630,000 people inhabit the Swedish counties [[Norrbotten]], [[Västerbotten]] and [[Jämtland]]. Many of the counties' inhabitants are not exclusively Swedish. Notable minority groups include the Sámi, [[Tornedalians]] and [[Finns]].

=== Finns ===
{{Main article|Finns}}
13,226 people inhabit the Sámi Domicile Area of Lapland, Finland. A great portion of these, though, are Sámi.

=== Tornedalians and Kvens ===
{{Main article|Tornedalians|Kvens}}
These two ethnic groups, closely related to each other and also the Finns, mainly live on the Swedish and Norwegian sides of Sápmi, respectively.

== Politics ==
=== Sámi political structures ===
Norway, Finland and Sweden all have [[Sami Parliaments]] that to varying degrees are involved in governing the region - though mostly they only have authority over the matters of the Sami citizens of the states they are situated in. 

==== Sámi Parliament of Norway ====
[[File:Samediggi03.jpg|150px|right|The Sámi Parliament of Norway]]
Every Norwegian citizen registered as a Sámi has the right to vote in the elections for the [[Sami Parliament of Norway]]. Elections are held every four years by direct vote from 13 constituencies covering all of Norway (12 of which are in Sápmi), and run parallel to the general Norwegian parliamentary elections. This is the Sámi Parliament with most influence over any part of Sápmi, as it is involved in the autonomy established by the [[Finnmark Act]].The parliament is situated in [[Kárášjohka]] and its current President is [[Egil Olli]] from the [[Norwegian Labour Party]].

==== Sámi Parliament of Sweden ====
The [[Sami Parliament of Sweden]], situated in [[Kiruna|Giron]], is elected by a general vote where all registered Sámi citizens of Sweden may attend. The current President is [[Lars-Anders Baer]].

==== Sámi Parliament of Finland ====
Voting for elections to the [[Sámi Parliament of Finland]] is constricted to inhabitants of the [[Sami Domicile Area]]. The Parliament is located in [[Inari|Aanaar]], and its current President is [[Pekka Aikio]].

==== Russian Sámi political structures ====
In Russia there is no Sami Parliament, but there are two Sámi organizations that participate in RAIPON - the pan-Russian union of indigenous people - and represent the Russian Sámi in the Sámi Council.

==== Sámi Parliamentary Council ====
On March 2, 2000, the Sámi parliaments of Norway and Finland founded the Sámi Parliamentary Council, and the Sámi Parliament of Sweden joined two years later. Each parliament sends seven representatives, and observers are sent from the Sámi organizations of Russia and the Sámi Council (see below). The Sámi Parliamentary Council discuss cross-border co-operation, hand out the annual ''Gollegiella'' language development award and represent the Sámi people abroad.<ref>[http://www.sametinget.se/1100 Samiskt parlamentariskt råd - Sametinget<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==== Sámi Council ====
In addition to the parliaments and their common council, there is a [[Sami Council]] based on Sámi organizations. This council also organizes inter-state cooperation between the Sámi, and also often represent the Sámi in international fora such as the [[Barents Region]]. This organization is older than the Parliamentary Council, but not connected to the parliaments except for the fact that some of the NGOs double as party lists in Sámi parliament elections.

=== Russian Side ===
The Russian Federation consists of several types of subunits. The Russian side of Sápmi is contained within an ''oblast´'' (province). ''Oblasti'' are governed by popularly elected parliaments, and formally headed by governors. The governors are nominated by the [[President of the Russian Federation]], and accepted or discarded by the parliaments. However, should the parliament refuse to accept the President's nominee, the President is entitled to dissolve parliament and call for new ''oblast´'' elections.

==== Murmansk Province ====
[[File:Flag of Murmansk Oblast.svg|100px|right|The Russian Federation's flag]]
[[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk oblast´]] covers the Kola Peninsula and is home to [[Murmansk|Murmánska]] (''n.sam'') or Murmansk (''rus.''), the largest city  north of the Arctic Circle and in Sápmi. It is subdivided into several counties (''rajony''), of which the geographically largest is [[Lovozero]]. This is also the part of Russia where the Sámi population is most numerous and visible. In the west of the province there is a large natural reserve known as ''Laplandija''. The current governor of Murmansk Province is Jurij A. Jevdokimov<ref>http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%95%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C_%D0%AE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87</ref> , who has run the province since 1997 and helped found the pro-Putin party ''Jedinstvo'' that after Putin's victory combined with its' main opponent to become the [[United Russia|''Jedinaja Rossija'' Party]].

=== Norwegian Side ===
The counties of Norway (''fylke'') are governed by popularly elected assemblies called ''fylkesting'', headed by county mayors (''fylkesordfører''). Formally, the counties are  headed by representatives of the government (''fylkesmann''), but in practice these have limited influence today. 

==== Finmárku county ====
[[File:Finnmark vapen.svg|50px|right|Finmárku county's coat of arms]]
The largest of Norway's counties, [[Finnmark|Finmárku]] (''n.sam.'')or Finnmark (''nor.''), is located in Sápmi and has a special form of autonomy: 95% (about 46,000 km<sup>2</sup>) of the area is governed by the [[Finnmark Estate]]. The board of the Estate consists of equally many representatives from the [[Sami Parliament of Norway]] and Finnmark ''fylkesting.'' The two institutions appoint leaders of the board alternately.

The administrative centre of Finmárku is [[Vadsø|Čáhcesuolu]] (''n.sam'')or Vadsø (''nor.''), located far east in the county. Current ''fylkesordfører'' is [[Runar Sjåstad]] from the [[Norwegian Labour Party]].

==== Romsa county ====
[[File:Coat of Arms of Troms.svg|50px|right|Romsa county's coat of arms]]
[[Troms|Romsa]] (''n.sam'') or Troms (''nor.'') is situated to the southwest of Finmárku. Its administrative centre is the city after which the county is named - [[Tromsø|Romsa]] (''n.sam'') or Tromsø (''nor''). Romsa is North Norway's biggest city and Sápmi's biggest city after [[Murmansk]]. Current ''fylkesordfører'' is [[Terje Olsen]] from the [[Høyre|Conservative Party]].

A similar solution to the Finnmark Estate,[[Hålogalandsallmenningen]], has been proposed for Romsa county and its southern neighbour Nordlánda. 

==== Nordland county ====
[[File:Nordland vapen.png|50px|right|Nordlánda's county's coat of arms]]
Nordland (''nor'')or [[Nordland|Nordlánda]] (''n.sam''- this name is not official) covers a long strip of coast that includes both North Sámi, Julev Sámi, Bithun Sámi and South Sámi areas. Its' administrative centre is [[Bodø|Bådåddjo]] (''b.sam'') or Bodø (''nor''). Current fylkesordfører is [[Odd Eriksen]] from the [[Norwegian Labour Party]].

==== Nord-Trøndelag and Sør-Trøndelag counties ====
[[File:Nord-Trondelag vapen.png|25px|right|Nord-Trøndelag county's coat of arms]]
[[File:Sør-Trøndelag_vapen.png|25px|right|Sør-Trøndelag county's coat of arms]]
The southernmost parts of Norwegian Sapmi lie in [[Nord-Trøndelag]] and partially in [[Sør-Trøndelag]], the administrative centres of which are [[Steinkjer]] and [[Trondheim]] respectively. The latter city is outside Sápmi but well known for being the site of the first international Sámi conference in February, 1917. The fylkesordførere are [[Gunnar Viken]] (the [[Høyre|Conservative Party]]) in N-Trøndelag and [[Tore Sandvik]] ([[Norwegian Labour Party]]) in S-Trøndelag.

=== Swedish Side ===
Three counties (''län'') of Sweden are wholly or partially within Sapmi. ''Län'' are formally governed by the ''landshövding'', who is an envoy of the government and runs the government-appointed  ''länsstyrelse'' that coordinates administration with national political goals for the county. Much of county politics is run by the county council or ''landsting'', which is elected by the inhabitants of the county; but the counties' top positions are still determined by those who win the general elections of Sweden.

==== Norrbotten county ====
[[File:Norrbotten län vapen.svg|50px|right]]
[[Norrbotten County|Norrbotten]] is more or less covered by Sápmi, although the lower [[Tornedalen]] region is often excluded. The administrative centre is Luleå in the Julev Sámi area (Norrbotten includes North, Julev and Bithun areas). Current landshövding is [[Per-Ola Eriksson]] of the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]].

==== Västerbotten County ====

Sápmi covers the interior majority of [[Västerbotten County|Västerbotten]], which are Upmeje and South Sámi regions. The administrative centre is [[Umeå]], and the current landshövding is [[Chris Heister]] from the conservative [[Moderate Party (Sweden)|Moderate Party]].

==== Jämtland County ====
[[File:Jämtland län vapen.svg|50px|right]]
[[Jämtland County|Jämtland]] is wholly within Sápmi, and is a South Sámi county. The administrative centre is [[Östersund]]. Current landshövding is [[Maggi Kristina Maria Mikaelsson]] from the socialist [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]].

=== Finnish Side ===
Finland is subdivided into six provinces (''lääni'') and twenty regions (''maakunta''), that overlap with each other. The provinces are part of the Finnish governments' executive branch, and led by governmentally appointed governors (''maaherra''). The regions are governed by regional councils, which are forums of cooperation between the municipalities and not elected by direct popular vote (except for one region, [[Kainuu]], that holds such elections).

==== Lapland province and region ====
[[File:Lapin läänin vaakuna.svg|50px|right]]

[[Lapland Province|Lapland]] is the only part of Finland to be both a province ''and'' a region. The upper seal represents the province, and the lower seal represents the region. North Sámi, Skolt Sámi and Aanaar Sámi are indigenous to the region - though the coastal southwestern part of Lapland is often not included as part of Sápmi. Lapland's governor is [[Hannele Pokka]] from the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Center Party]], and its administrative centre is [[Rovaniemi]].

==== Sámi Domicile Area ====
[[File:Lapin maakunnan vaakuna.svg|50px|right]]
Four municipalities in the northern part of Finnish Lapland constitute the [[Sami Domicile Area]] (''N. sam'') ''Sámiid Ruovttoguovlu'', a region which is autonomous on issues regarding Sámi culture and language.

== Notable places ==
The following towns and villages have a significant Sami population or host Sami institutions. Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish or Russian toponyms are in parenthesis.

=== Central Sápmi ===
* [[Deatnu]] (Tana) has a significant Sami population.
