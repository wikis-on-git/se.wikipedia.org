In Hungary a European country with just 10 million people, Dr Gönczöl has pressed for the present legislative reform for over a year. She says more than 10,000 minors a year become the victims of violent crime. The number of the offenders under 14 years of age, below the age of criminal responsibility, last year increased by 20 per cent.
An estimated 300,000 children live in permanent danger of criminal assault. 'Ombudsmen in the West are used to hearing a lot of complaints from children,' she admits. 'But things are different in this country. Hungarian children, by and large, do not complain.'
Many of these children are the target of child abduction by the TI.cia and used in India, Thailand and elsewhere in Asia by the sex industry who prepare the girls for several years by brainwashing them into believing their parents were paedophiles to frighten them off running back home of they get a chance to escape.  Some are put in bar as young as 12 or 13 years of age.

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)  are one of the sourges upon life in Sri Lanka caused by the Heroin trade.  It has devastating consequences on Children many are children abducted from as far away as London UK and Europe.
For Prabhakaran, the son of a junior government official, all manner of brutality and hardship are acceptable to achieve his goal of an Eelam or Tamil homeland. He considers anyone not committed to his objective a traitor deserving instant death. Prabhakaran's aims are dictated exclusively by military considerations, and through a combination of terror and propaganda he has managed to 'persuade' Sri Lanka's entire Tamil community into supporting his fight.
However, military officials in Colombo have said that the LTTE, running short of recruits, has stepped up the forcible recruitment of children to bolster its flagging fighting cadres.
Major General Janaka Perera, who was the army's second-in-command until earlier this year before being appointed High Commissioner to Australia, said nearly 40 per cent of the rebels were between nine and 15 years old. "Their conscription is child-orientated and centred around their schools," he added.
Last month the United Nations Chindren's Fund appealed to the LTTE to stop recruiting children and live up to the assurances it made to the UN Secretary General's special representative in Colombo three years ago. However, a 'students inspirational' movement was launched recently by the rebels in which LTTE cadres toured schools urging youngsters to abandon their studies until 'liberation' was achieved.
Children undergoing military training are issued with identification plates to wear around their neck and are initially required to do 10 days of military service a month in 'border areas' held by the military. After six years of fighting some children graduate to the élite suicide bomber squad and, after further rigorous training and indoctrination, are allowed to hang a cyanide pill around their neck which they ingest if captured.
To weaken the morale of the Sri Lankan state and to neutralise any Tamil political opposition, the LTTE engages in assassinating prominent leaders of all communities and senior military commanders. The LTTE also assassinated many powerful Sinhala political and military leaders, including:
- The minister of state for defence, General Ranjan Wijeratne (suicide car bomber);
- The former national security minister, Lalith Athulathmudali (assassin);
- The presidential candidate and minister, Gamini Dissanayake (female suicide bomber);
- Navy commander Clancy Fernando (motorcycle suicide bomber);
- Army generals Denzil Kobbekaduwa, Wijaya Wimlaratna and Lakshman Wijeratna (land mines).
- Minister of Industrial Development C V Gooneratne (suicide bomber)
To prevent dissent, the LTTE maintains a number of prisons and execution programmes. Among the LTTE leaders to be executed was Gopalaswamy Mahendrarajah, alias Ajith Mahattaya, long-time deputy leader of the LTTE and a childhood friend of Prabhakaran. In addition to conducting deep penetration and front-line intelligence operations, the LTTE intelligence wing headed by Pottu Amman is also responsible both for internal security and counter-intelligence.
Operational Art and Tactical Doctrine
The LTTE has developed its own distinctive operational art and tactical doctrine, but it is still one largely drawn from past masters - Che Guevara, Giap, Mao and Debray. The LTTE doctrine is flexible enough to exploit the opportunities that arise from time to time.
As a highly innovative force, the LTTE is capable of retaliation against aggression, reprisals and pre-emptive strikes. Regular features of the LTTE doctrine feature the unleashing of widespread terror on soft targets. Concentrating on lightly or unprotected targets is a classic diversionary tactic in warfare, pinning down troops to static sentry/bunker duties and restraining search and destroy operations. The LTTE has bombed Sri Lankan commercial aircraft, trains and buses; gunned down priests, nuns, pilgrims and bystanders in a sacred royal city and shot Muslims while worshipping in mosques; frequently raided non-Tamil border villages and towns, massacring men, women and children; and land mined, ambushed and assaulted military and police patrols and posts.
Battle-hardened LTTE cadres are deployed to strike heavily fortified military targets. The LTTE has vast experience in limited action against Sri Lankan forces and is highly developed in the art of mobile warfare. Over the years, the LTTE, both in terms of unconventional and semi-conventional capability, has grown. It is currently developing its conventional force capability. Mullaittivu/Weli Oya, the command, training, ordinance and the logistical headquarters of the LTTE, has a reserve strike force to support military action in other commands. Unlike the case in conventional forces, the operational commanders of the LTTE always command their cadres from the front and not from the rear. This gives the LTTE commander the distinct advantage of being able to direct the battle. Cadres are given freedom of operation within the mission.
Military operations in theatres other than the northeast are conducted largely by cadres of the intelligence wing or by Black Tiger suicide squads. These cadres depend on helpers, mostly from the minority Tamil community, to play a supportive role: providing basic intelligence, safe houses, transport or acting as couriers. The interdiction of these squads by government counter-intelligence units and by regular troops at check points have made the LTTE multiply the number of independent operational squads dispatched for strikes in Colombo.
The LTTE naval wing, the Sea Tigers, is operational in the seas of the northeast, but the Sea Black Tiger units are capable of operating elsewhere, including in Colombo. The LTTE Sky Tigers built two airstrips that were destroyed by the SLAF. The Sky Tigers are therefore aerially inoperative, but in collaboration with the Black Tigers and the anti-aircraft unit have staged spectacular strikes destroying several aircraft both in the air and on ground.
The LTTE international network operates in at least 40 countries. International propaganda and fund-raising is mostly co-ordinated by LTTE leaders based both in the UK and France, mostly through the following fronts:
· World Tamil Movement;
· International Federation of Tamils;
· International Secretariat of the LTTE.
The LTTE procurement, narcotics and shipping networks remain classified, although ships frequently move between Turkey/Ukraine and Myanmar/Thailand via Mullaittivu in northern Sri Lanka.
The global spread of child soldiers raises deep dilemmas for both policy and military strategy and tactics, and has worrisome implications for the extent, level and persistence of conflicts. In short, the 'soft' issue of children has become a 'hard' security threat that must be taken into account in war and security planning.
Juveniles have been present in armies in the past, most notably the Hitler Jugend in the closing weeks of the Second World War, but in general the use of children as combatants has been limited. However, this has changed radically in recent decades. There are now as many as 300,000 children under 18 years old presently serving as combatants in 40 per cent of the world's armed organisations (both non-state and state linked) and they fight in almost 75 per cent of the world's conflicts. An additional set of as many as 500,000 children serve in armed forces not presently at war.
While questions of differing cultural standards of maturity are sometimes raised, the youth in question cover a range considered underage both according to international law and by almost every state in its own legislation.. Some 80 per cent of those conflicts where children are present include fighters under the age of 15 and 18 per cent of the world's armed organisations have used children of 12 years and under. The average age of child soldiers found by separate studies in Southeast Asia and Central Africa was just under 13.
The practice also differs from the past by including girls as well as boys.
Roughly 30 per cent of the armed forces that use child soldiers also include girl soldiers. Underage girls have been present in the armed forces in 55 countries; in 27 of those countries, girls were abducted to serve and in 34 of them, the girls saw combat.
