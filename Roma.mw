== A MESSAGE FROM ALMIGHTY GOD == 

S'HAMAS - is a shame on us Irish.....

:::Hamas is being warned to cease causing any further conflict between themselves or third parties.
HAMAS HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND OUT WHO ARE THE TRUE FAMILIES OF THE CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN IN THEIR POSSESSION AND HAMAS MUST NOW HELP TO REUNITE THESE CHILDREN WITH THEIR GENUINE MOTHER AND FATHER WHERE POSSIBLE:::


The Heroin Cartel are using a ship/submarine/oil rig for the production of their 

Heroin and communicate using a mobile phone network to land line then fire-

walled to satellite to satellite phone receiver on a private network.
This is how you cannot trace their calls.
The crash into The Hudson river was planned by using migrating geese (possibly 

from Yugoslavia or Uganda) brought to the locality by Satanists-Heroin-

Scientology-Cartel-Sophonpanich
Some of the people involved are hiding out in Pattaya Thailand and come from 

many different countries. They are all connected to the Heroin Scientology world 

started by a member of a Nazi WW2 family who escaped to America and avoided 

prosecution.

son of Mervyn F S Young a WW2 Spitfire Fighter Pilot who was murdered in 2006 by the Scientology-Satanic-Heroin-Cartel-of-Sophonpanich-Thailand
Pattaya
Thailand
Still searching for Netnapa Taenjamras (my former wife) and one of the daughter's 

of The Sultan of Brunei (who I had hoped to become my wife one day).
I know two of my children are dead and cremated and bgelieve my daughter Panadta Mercedes N Young may also have been killed by the Heroin-Sophonpanich-Satanists. I am going to start killing more of them myself they are beyond evil totally SATANIC. If you think this is madness then the saints who wrote the books of the Bible are madmen.

It is the Sophonpanich-Heroin Cartel that caused the foundation of Hamas a heroin trading group. Hamas used the facade of political factors to disguise their true identity and business. I know this because I know the people they met in Amsterdam 40 years ago when they were starting up in business.
Some of the Satanists are here in Pattaya so please come here and help me to kill them.
